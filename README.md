# C Processes and Signals üñ•Ô∏èüîß

Welcome to the **C Processes and Signals** repository! This collection of exercises was developed as part of the Operating Systems course during my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Catania. Here, you will find various projects focusing on fundamental concepts in operating systems, particularly around processes and signals in the C programming language.

## Introduction

Operating systems play a crucial role in managing computer hardware and software resources. This repository aims to enhance your understanding of processes and signals through practical exercises. Each exercise is designed to reinforce key concepts and improve your coding skills in C.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can download the latest release of the project from the [Releases section](https://github.com/namthor997/C_Processes_Signals/releases). You will find executable files and source code for various exercises.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Git for version control
- Basic knowledge of C programming

## Topics Covered

This repository covers a variety of topics essential for understanding operating systems and concurrent programming:

- **Algorithms**: Learn about different algorithms used in process management.
- **C**: The primary programming language used in the exercises.
- **Concurrent Programming**: Explore how processes can run concurrently and manage shared resources.
- **Data Structures**: Understand how data structures are used in process management.
- **Debugging**: Techniques for debugging C programs.
- **English Language**: All documentation is in English to aid understanding.
- **Git and GitHub**: Learn to manage your code with version control.
- **Imperative Programming**: Focus on imperative programming principles.
- **Markdown**: Documentation is written in Markdown for clarity.
- **Project Management**: Organize and manage your coding projects effectively.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/namthor997/C_Processes_Signals.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd C_Processes_Signals
   ```

3. Compile the C files using your preferred compiler. For example, if you are using GCC, run:

   ```bash
